Smorphi-Pilot-ROS2

This repository contains the code and resources for the Smorphi-Pilot-ROS2 project, which enables control of a robotic system using both a PS4 joystick and an app developed with MIT App Inventor. The project leverages ROS 2 and a micro-ROS agent running on an ESP32 via Wi-Fi.
Features

    ROS 2 Integration: The project is built on ROS 2, enabling robust communication and control.
    Micro-ROS Agent on ESP32: Utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller with a micro-ROS agent, connected via Wi-Fi.
    Dual Control Options:
        PS4 Joystick: Control the robot using a PS4 joystick connected via USB.
        MIT App Inventor App: Control the robot through a custom app created in MIT App Inventor.

Project Components

    ROS 2 Nodes: Various nodes for handling joystick input, Wi-Fi communication, and robot control.
    Micro-ROS Agent: Running on ESP32 to interface with ROS 2 over Wi-Fi.
    PS4 Joystick Integration: Using ROS 2 packages to process joystick input and control the robot.
    MIT App Inventor App: A user-friendly interface for controlling the robot via Wi-Fi.
